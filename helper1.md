**Explanation 1:**

1. **Traditional approach:**
    * You need user information for a product.
    * You first call the product API to get the product details, including the `userId`.
    * Then, you need to make a separate call to the user API with the retrieved `userId` to get the complete user information.
    * This involves two separate API calls and potentially more code to handle the data fetching and stitching.

2. **Problem with traditional approach:**
    * Making multiple API calls can be inefficient and cumbersome, especially for nested data structures.
    * It requires you to write code to handle multiple API calls and combine the data manually.

3. **Solution with `@ResolveReference`:**
    * The `@ResolveReference` function in Apollo Federation allows you to resolve user data directly within the product query itself.
    * When the product query encounters a `userId` reference, Apollo Federation calls the `resolveReference` function in the Users microservice.
    * This function fetches the complete user data using the provided `userId`.
    * Finally, Apollo Federation combines the product data and the fetched user data into a single response.

**Benefits of `@ResolveReference`:**

* **Single API call:** You only need to make a single GraphQL query to get all the data (product and user) in one go.
* **Cleaner code:**  You avoid writing code for multiple API calls and data stitching, making your code cleaner and easier to maintain.



**Explanation 2:**

Imagine an e-commerce app where you have separate microservices for Products and Users. A product might have a `userId` field referencing the user who created it. Without Apollo Federation's `resolveReference`, you'd need to call two separate APIs:

1. Get the product details (including `userId`).
2. Call another API to get the user details based on the `userId` from step 1.

This can be cumbersome and inefficient.

**How `resolveReference` solves this problem:**

The `resolveReference` function helps Apollo Federation stitch data together from different microservices. Here's an example:

```typescript
// Inside your Users service (where user data lives)

import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { User } from './user.entity'; // Replace with your user model

@Injectable()
export class UsersService {
  async findOne(id: string): Promise<User> {
    // This would typically fetch user data from a database or other source
    return { id, name: 'John Doe', email: 'john.doe@example.com' }; // Replace with your user data fetching logic
  }
}

// Inside your Product resolver (where the product schema is defined)

import { Resolver, Query, ReferenceObject } from '@nestjs/graphql';
import { Product } from './product.entity'; // Replace with your product model
import { UsersService } from '../users/users.service';

@Resolver(() => Product)
export class ProductsResolver {
  constructor(private readonly usersService: UsersService) {}

  @Query(() => Product)
  async product(@ReferenceObject() reference: { __typename: string; id: string }) {
    // This fetches the product data (including the user ID)
    const product = { id: 'prod_123', name: 'T-Shirt', userId: 'user_456' };
    return product;
  }

  @ResolveReference()
  async resolveReference(reference: { __typename: string; id: string }): Promise<User> {
    if (reference.__typename === 'User') {
      return await this.usersService.findOne(reference.id);
    }
    return null;
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. The `UsersService` has a `findOne` function that simulates fetching user data based on ID.
2. The `ProductsResolver` has a `product` query that fetches product data (including `userId`).
3. The `@ResolveReference` decorator marks the `resolveReference` function.
4. The `resolveReference` function takes a `reference` argument with `__typename` and `id` properties.
5. It checks if `__typename` is "User" and then calls `usersService.findOne` to get the complete user data.
6. Finally, the `product` query returns the product data along with the resolved user data (fetched by `resolveReference`).

**Expected Output (JSON):**

```json
{
  "data": {
    "product": {
      "id": "prod_123",
      "name": "T-Shirt",
      "user": {
        "id": "user_456",
        "name": "John Doe",
        "email": "john.doe@example.com"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**

* This approach provides all the data (product and user) in a single GraphQL response, even though it comes from separate microservices.
* It avoids the need for multiple API calls and manual data stitching, making your code cleaner and more efficient.
